## Overview
<img align="right" src="https://github.com/Veilza/veilza.github.io/blob/main/src/assets/navicon.webp" width="150px">Hello! My name is Veilza and [this](https://veilza.github.io/) is my site to cover all my development activities. I dabble in web development, software development and game development, and I'll be showing off everything I work on here.~

Additionally! This site will also host various other non-software things I create, such as art I've gotten commissioned and stories I write, and I'll also be putting things that are relevant to how to contact me.

Oh! I'm a vtuber too, so there'll be information about my vtuber activities here as well~! I think that's everything! Go look!
